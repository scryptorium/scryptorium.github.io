<title>Jospeh Michel Dion's Blog</title>
<body>
<p>My name is Joseph Michel Dion. I have been working as a software developper/architect for the last 20 years.</p>
<p>My interest for electronics and computers emerged at an early age. As a young child, I grew up playing with wires, resistors, capacitors and other electronic pieces; making small machines with them. During the microcomputer revolution, this hobby evolved from hardware to software offering me the chance to write my first lines of code on a VIC20 and to play with this new kind of “language” that runs on machines. Afterwards, the gates of this playground opened up to more fundamental questions, related artificial intelligence, cognitive sciences; with a specific focus on the question of the language : what is the relationship between the language structure and the mind ? My master's thesis, that I got with honors academic excellence, addressed this topic from a literary standpoint. Since then, an important part of my readings is related to domains of philosophy, psychology, semiotics, cognitive science and their possible relationships with computer science.</p>
<p>I created this site to write posts on various topics in relation with my interests. </p>
